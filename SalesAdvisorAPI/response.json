Address delays/stalls early in the sales cycle (Based on simulation: 'Address top qual risk 'delays_stalls'' - +15.0% uplift, Medium confidence)  \n2. Assign to Hayden Neloms for higher win rates (Based on simulation: 'Assign to Hayden Neloms' - +11.46% uplift, Medium confidence)  \n3. Assign to Maureen Marcano for strong performance (Based on simulation: 'Assign to Maureen Marcano' - +10.77% uplift, High confidence)  \n4. Conduct product demo workshop early in sales cycle (Based on qualitative win driver: 'demo_success' - 88.34% of won deals had successful demos)  \n5. Offer bundled packages with support services (Based on qualitative win driver: 'bundling_support' - 26.69% of won deals included bundling)\n\n---\n\n**⚠️ REMOVALS/RISKS TO AVOID**\n\n1. Avoid delays or stalls in decision-making (Based on qualitative loss risk: 'delays_stalls' - 39.94% of lost deals had this issue)  \n2. Address competitive positioning early (Based on qualitative loss risk: 'competitor' - 22.63% of lost deals lost to competitors)  \n3. Avoid pricing concerns; emphasize value-based selling (Based on qualitative loss risk: 'pricing_high' - 20.11% of lost deals had pricing issues)\n\n---\n\n**📈 ESTIMATED WIN PROBABILITY IMPROVEMENT**\n\n1. **Address delays/stalls early in the sales cycle** → +15.0% win probability improvement  \n   - Source: Qualitative insight (Medium confidence)  \n   - Why: Delays/stalls are the most frequent loss risk (39.94% of lost deals). Proactively addressing this risk can significantly improve win rates.\n\n2. **Assign to Hayden Neloms** → +11.46% win probability improvement  \n   - Source: Quantitative simulation (Medium confidence)  \n   - Why: Hayden Neloms has the highest win rate (70.39%) among reps, with a strong lift of 11.46% compared to baseline.\n\n3. **Assign to Maureen Marcano** → +10.77% win probability improvement  \n   - Source: Quantitative simulation (High confidence)  \n   - Why: Maureen Marcano has consistently high performance (69.95% win rate) and strong alignment with similar deals in this sector and region.\n\n---\n\n**🚀 CONSIDER**\n\n1. Consider assigning to Wilburn Farren for strong performance (Based on simulation: 'Assign to Wilburn Farren' - +10.25% uplift, Medium confidence)  \n2. Consider assigning to Cecily Lampkin for moderate improvement (Based on simulation: 'Assign to Cecily Lampkin' - +5.91% uplift, Medium confidence)  \n\n---\n\n**FINAL NOTES:**  \nThis opportunity has strong alignment with historical success factors for GTX Pro in the medical sector and United States region. However, addressing delays/stalls and assigning a top-performing rep are critical to maximizing win probability. Additionally, bundling and demo success should be prioritized to mitigate pricing concerns and enhance perceived value.",
